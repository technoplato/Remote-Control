# Software Requirements Specification

## Claude.ai Remote Control Proof of Concept

### 1. Introduction

#### 1.1 Purpose

This document specifies the software requirements for a proof of concept (PoC) system to remotely control and interact with the Claude.ai web chat interface.

#### 1.2 Scope

The system will provide a means to monitor, control, and interact with the Claude.ai web chat interface through a local server, using mutation observers and web sockets.

### 2. System Overview

The system consists of two main components:

1. A client-side script running in the browser, monitoring the Claude.ai web chat interface.
2. A local server to process data and control the web chat interface.

### 3. Functional Requirements

#### 3.1 Milestone 1: Basic Chat Interaction

3.1.1 The system shall detect Claude's response state:

- Responding
- Generating a response
- Finished responding

3.1.2 The system shall read messages in real-time using mutation observers.

3.1.3 The system shall forward mutations to a local server.

3.1.4 The system shall queue messages and send them when Claude is in a ready state.

#### 3.2 Milestone 2: Artifact Handling

3.2.1 The system shall detect when Claude is generating an artifact.

3.2.2 The system shall save artifacts to the local machine as special files.

3.2.3 The system shall concatenate all responses into one file (initial implementation).

#### 3.3 Milestone 3: Conversation Separation

3.3.1 The system shall separate Claude responses based on the URL and title of the Claude web chat page.

#### 3.4 Milestone 4: Advanced UI Interactions

3.4.1 The system shall interact with various UI elements, including:

- Star chat functionality
- Chat controls
- Artifact management (copy, download, add to project files)
- Project content management

3.4.2 The system shall handle project files and content.

3.4.3 The system shall manage conversation artifacts.

### 4. Non-Functional Requirements

4.1 Performance: The system shall operate with minimal latency to ensure real-time interaction.

4.2 Security: The system shall ensure secure communication between the client-side script and the local server.

4.3 Compatibility: The system shall be compatible with the latest version of the Claude.ai web interface.

### 5. System Architecture

5.1 Client-side Component:

- Mutation observers for monitoring the web interface
- WebSocket client for communication with the local server

5.2 Server-side Component:

- WebSocket server for receiving client data
- Data processing and storage capabilities
- Command queue for controlling the web interface

### 6. Future Considerations

6.1 Implement more advanced artifact handling and organization.

6.2 Develop a user interface for the local server to manage interactions.

6.3 Extend functionality to interact with other parts of the Claude.ai interface (e.g., settings, projects).
