This message accomplishes several things:

1. It pays homage to Neil Armstrong's famous quote, drawing a parallel between the moon landing and this technological advancement.
2. It highlights the significance of the remote control capability we've just implemented.
3. It prompts Claude to consider and discuss the implications of this technology, which should lead to an interesting conversation.
